# The Snow SMATI, Spatial Fusion / Mixture Analysis / Temporal Interpolation

This work is the responds to practical packaging of the methodology published in the open acces journal [MDPI Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing)
The paper ***Snow Cover Reconstruction in the Brunswick Peninsula, Patagonia, Derived from a Combination of the Spectral Fusion, Mixture Analysis, and Temporal Interpolation of MODIS Data*** explores and compares different methodologies to implement a high resolution (spatial and temporal) studies of snow cover at high latitudes enviroments.

The main objective of this project is to facilitate the implementation and continuous testing of this methodology, providing everything necessary for its understanding and implementation.

***the coding has been tested and proved in both Linux and MAC (M1) environments***
- Testet in R v.4.4 and Python v.3.11
- Problems caused by the removal of some R packages (i.e., Rgdal and modiscloud) for the new R versions were solved
