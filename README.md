# The Snow SMATI, Spatial Fusion / Mixture Analysis / Temporal Interpolation
This work is the responds to practical packaging of the methodology published in [MDPI Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing)
The paper **Snow Cover Reconstruction in the Brunswick Peninsula, Patagonia, Derived from a Combination of the Spectral Fusion, Mixture Analysis, and Temporal Interpolation of MODIS Data** explores and compares different methodologies to implement a high resolution (spatial and temporal) studies of snow cover at high latitudes enviroments.
