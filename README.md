# The Snow SMATI 
## Spatial Fusion / Mixture Analysis / Temporal Interpolation

This work responds to the practical packaging of the methodology published in the open-access journal [MDPI Remote Sensing](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing)

The paper ***Snow Cover Reconstruction in the Brunswick Peninsula, Patagonia, Derived from a Combination of the Spectral Fusion, Mixture Analysis, and Temporal Interpolation of MODIS Data*** explores and compares different methodologies to implement a high resolution (spatial and temporal) studies of snow cover at high latitudes enviroments.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15225430

The main objective of this project is to facilitate the implementation and continuous testing of this methodology, providing everything necessary for its understanding and implementation.

***the coding has been tested and proved in both Linux and MAC (M1) environments***
- Testet in R v.4.4 and Python v.3.11
- Problems caused by the removal of some R packages (i.e., Rgdal, modiscloud) for newer **R** versions were solved

### Funding
This study was co-funded by the FNDR GORE Magallanes “Programa de Transferencia Científico Tecnológico Modelamiento Climático Planificación, XII Región, Código BIP N° 30462410”, known as the MoCliM Programme, executed by the Chilean Antarctic Institute (INACH), with the collaboration of Universidad de Magallanes. Proyecto MIAS from the Innovation Directorate of the Universidad de Magallanes funded the publication costs.

### Future developments and updates
- Implement parallel execution for all the scripts
- Add the scripts to perform the analysis and validation of the snow products
